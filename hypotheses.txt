+ Add RDKit features to query alongside top-k results
+ [improved all except LogD] Include more training data like Biogen ADME even if data units are different (consider them as new tasks in this case)
- Predict all properties including for external data as separate dataset
Predict single property given the same data context
Design test-neighbours-based data splits
- Train Gemini Flash on filtered data as in Chemprop
+ Try MACCS keys instead of Morgan fingerprints for top-k similarity in prompt construction
Generate molecules based on a property value - can be used as synthetic data expansion
- Check k-nn baseline
+ [improves on 1st round of cleaning] clean worst 20% predictions on validation from each split's training set
Try pyboost
+ Fine-tune Gemini Flash / Pro on leave-one-out problem
Try properties of topk similar molecules as features for pyboost
Train model, predict missing values in train, re-train on full data
Ensemble all models predictions in pyboost
Chemistry arithmetics model - fine-tune Gemini to model property difference when substructing two SMILES
- Finetune Gemini on SMILES strings only
- Finetune Gemini on LogD of top-50 closest molecules
- Protonate compounds at pH 7.4
+[10 epochs is optimal] Train Gemini Flash for a smaller amount of epochs, e.g. 5, 10
- [didn't work for 0.2 cutoff] Filter data based on high deviation of predictions for different enantiomers where stereochemistry is undefined
Change val_loss to val_mae as tuning metric in Ray
Fix stereo impure filtering to not exclude |a*|
- [almost same as Gemini, needs tuning] Try GPT-4o/4o-mini fine-tuning
Convert data units to most common
