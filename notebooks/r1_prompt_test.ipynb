    "# Multi-Parameter Optimization: Identifying high quality compounds with a balance of properties\n",
    "# A successful drug that passes the hurdles of clinical trials to gain approval and a strong market position must exhibit a delicate balance of biological and physicochemical properties. Such a compound must, of course, be potent against its intended physiological target(s); however, it must also have appropriate pharmacokinetics to reach the site of the target at a sufficiently high concentration and for an appropriate duration via the intended route of administration. Furthermore, for the compound to be safely administered, it must avoid unintended side-effects, drug-drug interactions and non-specific or idiosyncratic toxicities at the therapeutic dose. The goal of drug discovery is to identify a successful compound as efficiently as possible. But, as the history of drug discovery has proved, this is a challenge of significant proportions [1].\n",
    "# This task is made even more difficult by the fact that, in drug discovery, data on the behavior of the compound in the ultimate target patient population, i.e. humans, is not available. This has led to the development of a plethora of in silico, in vitro, and in vivo animal models from which we can (hopefully) infer the likely in vivo efficacy, disposition and safety of a compound in humans. These include models for the prediction and measurement of potency and selectivity against molecular targets or off-targets; absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination (ADME) properties; cell-based measurements of pharmacological activity and toxicity; and animal models of pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicity. The cost and throughput of these techniques vary, from in silico methods which typically have the lowest cost and highest throughput, through in vitro and cell-based assays to lengthy and expensive in vivo studies, the use of which we would also like to minimize for ethical reasons. Therefore, drug discovery is a process of simultaneously optimizing all of these factors as compounds are designed, synthesized and progressed through a cascade of assays to accumulate data.\n",
    "# This balancing act is difficult to achieve through a purely intellectual process. Psychologists have repeatedly demonstrated that people are very poor at making decisions based on complex and uncertain data when there is a lot at stake, such as in drug discovery. Several biases in decision-making (described as cognitive biases) have been identified that can detrimentally affect efficiency and productivity in drug discovery. A detailed discussion of some of these, with examples, may be found in [2]; however two illustrative examples are:\n",
    "#  Confirmation bias: The tendency to seek data that confirms a pre-formed hypothesis, rather than perform experiments designed to yield results to challenge the hypothesis. This can lead to a premature focus on a small range of options, which may lead to missed opportunities or late stage failures of compounds that have been progressed too far in the search for the one piece of data that would prove the point.\n",
    "#  Excess focus on certainty: The tendency to seek additional data to be ‘absolutely certain’ of a critical factor, even when this data adds little value at a high cost. Often a more significant increase in the confidence around a slightly less important factor may have a greater effect on the overall chance of success. This can lead to inefficient use of resources when considering multiple property requirements and to late stage, expensive failures.\n",
    "# The historical evidence regarding the attrition and productivity of pharmaceutical research and development supports this observation. The increasing complexity and volume of data being generated in drug discovery has not improved success rates in development – 11% in 2000 [3] versus 12% in 2010 [1] – while the cost per marketed drug has continued to escalate – from an estimated fully capitalized cost of $802M in 2001 [4] to $1,778M in 2010 [1] – and productivity, as measured by the number of registered new chemical entities, has fallen [5]. There are a wide range of theories regarding the underlying cause of these effects, but it is safe to conclude that generating additional, early-stage data has not resulted in the improvements anticipated in the outcomes.\n",
    "# Fortunately, we may learn from other fields that face the same need to balance many factors in the design of a successful solution. These fields range from engineering disciplines, such as aerospace or automotive design, to economics. The resulting methods are commonly described under the broad term “Multi-parameter Optimization” (MPO) or sometimes also “Multi-dimensional Optimization” (MDO) or “Multi-objective Optimization” (MOOP). For convenience, we will use the term MPO to describe all of the methods in this review.\n",
    "# There is a significant difference between applications of MPO methods to drug discovery and other fields, in particular engineering. This relates to the quality of the data available on the potential designs or prototypes from which a selection must be made. In an engineering discipline, characteristics may commonly be measured to accuracies within parts per million or predicted computationally to within a fraction of a percent. This may be contrasted with drug discovery where measured properties, such as IC50 or Ki values, may have an experimental variability of a factor of two, while predictions may have statistical uncertainties of an order of magnitude. This dramatically increases the challenge because, even if an ideal compound exists among the available options, we cannot expect to identify it with absolute confidence, thus running the risk of missing opportunities for high quality drugs [6].\n",
    "# In our research into the requirements for an ideal MPO method for drug discovery, we identified the following factors that should be taken into account:\n",
    "#  Interpretability: The property criteria and their impact on compound priority should be easy to understand. A ‘black box’ method that does not provide an easy way to understand why a compound has been classified in a given way is likely to be discounted. Furthermore, a ‘black box’ does not provide any guidance on the way one should go about making improvements in order to increase the chance of success.\n",
    "#  Flexibility: Each project will have a different set of property criteria depending on the therapeutic objectives of the project, intended route of administration and competitive conditions in the market. The project team should be able to define appropriate criteria based on their experience or historical evidence.\n",
    "#  Weighting: The project team should be able to assign different weights to each property criterion, as different criteria will have different degrees of importance to the outcome of the project. For example identifying a compound that is potent against the intended target is critical, while other properties will be less important, particularly early in a project when there is an opportunity for redesign to overcome liabilities.\n",
    "#  Uncertainty: It is important to avoid rejecting potentially valuable compounds based on a property value that fails to meet a criterion if that value has a high level of uncertainty. The opportunity cost of incorrectly rejecting a good compound may be very high, particularly when the range of alternative options is limited.\n",
    "# Coincidentally, it seems that the development of a suitable MPO approach for drug discovery is itself an MPO problem!\n",
    "# One common question is, “Can’t this be easily solved by visualization of the data?” While visualization is necessary to understand and communicate results, it is not sufficient to allow conclusions to be easily drawn, given the complexity of the data at hand. One common approach is to plot multi-dimensional data, for example on a three dimensional graph with additional parameters shown by the colors and sizes of the points. An alternative is a ‘traffic light’ view where the properties of each compound are shown in a table and colored according to whether they ‘pass’ (green), ‘fail’ (red) or are ‘close’ (yellow) to the relevant criterion. However, even with only five-dimensional data, it is difficult to confidently draw a conclusion from these visualizations even before we consider the relative importance of each property or the uncertainty in the data. An MPO method helps a project team to define a set of criteria and use this pro-actively to guide their decisions to quickly target high quality compounds [7].\n",
    "# In this review, we will explore a range of different MPO approaches that have been applied to drug discovery and compare their strengths and weaknesses relative to the requirements described above. The methods that we will discuss in order of increasing sophistication, include ‘rules-of-thumb’ that provide chemists with guidelines for compound characteristics, simple pass/fail filters, Pareto optimization, desirability functions and probabilistic scoring, which brings together all of the requirements discussed above. We will also consider the role of chemical diversity to mitigate risk when selecting compounds for further investigation. Finally, we will illustrate some of the methods using examples taken from the literature before drawing our conclusions.\n",
    "# Rules of Thumb\n",
    "# Perhaps the most common approach used to consider the quality of compounds relative to criteria beyond potency are ‘rules of thumb’ that provide guidelines regarding desirable compound characteristics. The best known is undoubtedly Lipinski’s Rule of Five (RoF) [8], which proposes criteria for four basic characteristics that Lipinski identified as being satisfied by the majority of orally absorbed compounds, namely:\n",
    "#  Molecular Weight (MW) < 500\n",
    "#  Logarithm of the octanol:water partition coefficient (logP) < 5\n",
    "#  Number of Hydrogen Bond Donors (HBD) < 5\n",
    "#  Number of Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (HBA) < 10\n",
    "# Subsequently, several other rules have been proposed, for example Veber et al. [9] identified that most of the 1100 compounds they studied with oral bioavailability of greater than 20% in rats had less than 10 rotatable bonds and a Polar Surface Area (PSA) of less than 140 Å2. However, Lu et al. [10] repeated this study with a set of 434 compounds and showed that the criteria depended on the method used for calculation, providing one illustration of the need for flexibility in the criteria depending on the source of data.\n",
    "# Johnson et al. identified rules based on MW and the logarithm of the octanol:buffer partition coefficient at pH7.4 (logD) to achieve permeability and metabolic stability [11]. In this case, rather than expressing these rules as criteria for the individual characteristics, Johnson et al. identified correlations that led them to express the rules in terms of a ‘golden triangle’ that defines an optimal region in (MW,logD) space in which a compound should lie (illustrated in Figure 1).\n",
    "# elogD\n",
    "#  MW\n",
    "#  Figure 1. An illustration of the “Golden Triangle” [11] proposed by Johnson et al. Compounds within the shaded region in (MW, logD) space were found to have a higher chance of achieving better outcomes for permeability and metabolic stability. This is a convenient visual rule-of- thumb for selecting compounds.\n",
    "# Other rules, involving parameters such as the fraction of carbons which are sp3 hybridized [12] and the number of aromatic rings [13] have been proposed as measures of developability or likelihood of clinical success. Furthermore, Hughes et al. [14] studied the relationship between physicochemical properties and adverse events observed in in vivo toleration studies. They concluded that compounds with both calculated logP (clogP) > 3 and topological polar surface area (TPSA) < 75 Å2 had a significantly increased safety risk.\n",
    "# The undoubted popularity of these rules derives from their simplicity and interpretability, the first requirement for a good MPO method. It is very easy to calculate these characteristics and quickly check if a compound obeys these rules. Similarly it is easy to understand how to modify a compound that fails to meet these rules in order to improve its chance of success; it is clear how MW, HBD or HBA could be reduced and\n",
    "\n",
    "#  chemists have a good understanding of the influence of chemical functionalities on lipophilicity. Therefore, these rules-of-thumb provide an easy approach to selecting compounds and guiding their redesign.\n",
    "# The main disadvantage of these rules-of-thumb is also due to their simplicity. There may be a tendency to over-interpret simple rules and apply them with too much rigor. For example, does a compound with a MW of 501 have a significantly worse chance of oral absorption than one with MW of 500? Indeed, Lipinski’s original paper [8] suggested that two or more failures against the RoF criteria were required to significantly decrease the chance of oral absorption, so the rules were not intended to be applied individually.\n",
    "# These rules are derived from a review of historically successful drugs and are often treated as absolute rules that define ‘drug likeness.’ However, compounds for different therapeutic indications or routes of administration may require different characteristics or be more tolerant to violations of these rules. For example, there has been a tendency for the RoF to be considered as a definition of the conditions for ‘drug likeness’ when it is only based on analysis of the requirements for orally absorbed drugs. Drugs intended for topical, IV, inhaled or other routes of administration can violate some or all of the rules without a significant impact on their chance of success [15]. Therefore, the criteria and weight given to each of these rules-of- thumb should be defined or applied flexibly according to the therapeutic objectives of a project. Unfortunately, this is not a straightforward exercise, as careful statistical analysis of a large number of compounds is required to identify statistically significant criteria.\n",
    "# The majority of the characteristics used in these rules-of-thumb do not have any underlying uncertainty, as they are simple values calculated from the molecular structure. The principal exception to this is lipophilicity (logP or logD) which, if calculated, typically has an uncertainty (root-mean-square-error) of at least 0.5 log units. Therefore, care should be taken when drawing conclusions regarding compounds close to the criterion for lipophilicity.\n",
    "# Finally, we should consider the confidence in the ‘prediction’ by a rule-of-thumb. As an illustrative example, we applied the RoF to a set of 1191 marketed drugs labeled according to whether they have been approved for oral administration and the results are shown in Table 1. Although, one should be careful not to over interpret these results, we can see that passing the RoF is not a guarantee of finding an orally available compound. This is not surprising, as the RoF was derived from observations of absorption and other factors such as first pass metabolism can limit oral bioavailability. However, the specificity of the RoF is also low (21%), as more non-orally administered compounds pass the RoF than fail and a significant proportion of compounds that fail the RoF are orally administered.\n",
    "# Table 1. The results of applying Lipinski’s Rule of Five to 1191 marketed drugs labeled as oral or non-oral according to their approved route of administration.\n",
    "# Oral 709 59 Non-oral 333 90\n",
    "# In summary, rules-of-thumb can provide very convenient and easily applied guidelines for the selection of compounds with a greater chance of yielding successful drugs, if used in the appropriate context. However, one should be careful about being overly rigid regarding their application as this could lead to missed opportunities.\n",

    "                  \n",
    "#  Filtering\n",
    "# Another simple approach to applying multiple criteria to the selection of compounds is sequential filtering. In this process the compounds are compared to series of criteria; those that fail to meet a criterion are discarded while those that meet the criterion are progressed for comparison against the next criterion in the sequence. The hope is that one or more ‘ideal’ compounds will emerge from the sequence of filters, having passed all of the criteria. Filtering offers the benefit that interpretation is straightforward, because if a compound fails one or more criteria this clearly indicates the focus for improving the compound.\n",
    "# The set of criteria against which compounds are compared can be based on any relevant properties, whether calculated or experimental. This offers the flexibility that a drug discovery project may choose criteria that are tailored to the project objectives, based on the experience of the project team or historical data for successful compounds for the intended therapeutic indication. These criteria are sometimes referred to as a target product profile (TPP) and an illustrative example of such a profile for identification of a lead compound for an orally dosed compound is shown in Table 2. Early in a project, for example when choosing a screening library for high throughput screening, it is also common to apply the criteria indicated by one of more of the rules-of- thumb discussed above as sequential filters.\n",

    "# One challenge of filtering is that it is common for no compounds to emerge from the end of the sequence; there are several possible reasons for this:\n",
    "#  There are often conflicts between the property criteria; improving one property often leads to an adverse change in another. In these situations, the relative importance of each criterion should be taken into account as this defines acceptable trade-offs against conflicting properties.\n",
    "#  Simple yes/no criteria may be too strict; For example, if a compound meets all of the criteria in the TPP, except that it has a logP of 5.1 versus a criterion of <5, does it make sense to reject it?\n",
    "#  There may have been a mis-measurement or mis-prediction; one or more compounds may have been incorrectly rejected due to the experimental variability or statistical error in a prediction.\n",
    "# The last of these is probably the biggest concern about filtering because, as we discussed above, there is significant uncertainty in almost all of the data which is available in early drug discovery. If we consider a\n",

Therefore, even in this optimistic case, sequential filtering is more likely to discard an ideal compound than accept it. Furthermore, there is a significant chance of incorrectly passing a poor compound; in this example, if a compound should correctly fail only one of the criteria, the probability of it being incorrectly accepted is 4%. Given that there are typically many more poor compounds than good, this means that any ideal compound that is fortunate enough to be correctly passed by all of the filters is likely to be swamped by poor compounds incorrectly accepted.\n",
    "# Therefore, despite the simplicity and easy interpretation of filtering, it should be treated with caution. The process accumulates error without that being transparent, running the risk of rejecting good compounds and missing opportunities to find a high quality drug.\n",
    "# Calculated Metrics\n",
    "# Rather than defining criteria for multiple, individual properties these may be combined to calculate a single metric that can be optimized to guide selection or design. One of the earliest and most commonly applied metrics is the Ligand Efficiency (LE) proposed by Hopkins et al. [18], with the goal of mitigating the tendency to focus too heavily on the optimization of potency at the cost of other necessary properties. LE was derived from the observation that smaller compounds tend to have better physicochemical and ADME properties than large compounds. Therefore, given two equally potent compounds it is preferable to choose the smaller. Or, alternatively, increasing potency without significantly increasing compound size is desirable. LE is defined as:,\n",
    "# where G is the free energy of binding and NH is the number of heavy (i.e. non-Hydrogen) atoms in the compound. In more common units, this may be expressed as:,\n",
    "# where pIC50 = -log(IC50) and the IC50 is expressed in molar concentration.\n",
    "# The use of the LE metric is particularly popular in fragment-based drug design [19], where the starting point is typically one or more small fragments with low binding affinity and new compounds are designed by growing or linking these fragments to identify a larger compound with sufficient potency. Although the initial fragments bind only weakly, they have a high LE due to their small size and the optimization process may be guided by increasing the potency while maintaining a high LE.\n",
    "# The LE metric inspired other calculated optimization metrics, for example Ligand Lipophilicity Efficiency (LLE) [20], also known as Lipophilic Efficiency (LipE):\n",
    "# where a calculated value of logP is often used. This was motivated by the desire to maximize potency while maintaining as low a lipophilicity as possible, due to the association between high lipophilicity and several issues including poor solubility, membrane permeation and metabolic stability, lack of selectivity and a higher risk of non-specific toxicity [21] [22].\n",
    "# The range of efficiency metrics has been further extended to include percent efficiency index (PEI), defined as the percent inhibition (as a fraction between 0 and 1) divided by MW in kDa; binding efficiency index (BEI), defined as pIC50 divided by MW in kDa; and surface efficiency index (SEI), defined as pIC50 divided by PSA in 100s of Å. All of these combine a measure of potency related to another property representing the ‘drug- likeness’ of the compound and are reviewed in detail in [23]. More complex derivatives of these efficiency indexes have also been proposed including ligand efficiency-dependent lipophilicity (LEDL), defined as logP divided by LE [24] and ‘fit quality’ [25].\n",
    "# These calculated metrics have the advantage that they are simple to apply, as only a single value must be monitored during optimization. They are also easy to interpret – Increase potency while minimizing the increase in compound size or lipophilicity – although this ease of interpretation may be sacrificed somewhat by the more complex efficiency indexes such as LEDL.\n",
    "#  In many cases rules-of-thumb have been developed for selection of high quality compounds using these metrics. For example, it has been proposed that a LLE of 6 or higher is preferable, corresponding to a potency of better than 10 nM with a logP of 2. Again these provide useful guidelines when applied in an appropriate context, but the same caveats apply here as to the rules-of-thumb discussed above, in particular:\n",
    "#  Potency and logP values have significant uncertainty, particularly when predicted, yet it is rare to see the uncertainties propagated through the calculation of the efficiency metric to consider the confidence with which compounds may be chosen based on these metrics.\n",
    "#  As noted above, increasing compound size, MW and logP significantly increases the chance of encountering issues with poor physicochemical, ADME and toxicity. However, the correlation with these properties is not perfect, so it may be inappropriate to make selections based too strictly on these metrics, particularly when options are limited.\n",
    "#  These rules are not universal and are typically based on identification of orally administered drugs, so the project’s therapeutic objective should be considered carefully before choosing a criterion.\n",
    "# It is noteworthy that there is a close relationship between the optimization based on these metrics and a recent trend to optimize compounds based on measurements of the thermodynamic parameters of binding using biophysical measurements [26]. This strategy suggests that it is better to increase binding affinity (or equivalently decrease the free energy G, as strong binding is equivalent to a reduction in free energy) by introducing an interaction dominated by decreasing the enthalpy of binding ( H) rather than one dominated by increasing entropy ( S) – note G = H - T S, where T is the temperature. Decreasing the binding free energy by reducing the enthalpy is achieved by forming a specific interaction with the target, for example a hydrogen bond with a residue in the binding pocket, which will typically improve the LE or LLE. The free energy can also be reduced by increasing the entropy and this can be achieved by displacing coordinated water molecules from the binding pocket into bulk solvent, for example by adding a bulky lipophilic group to occupy the binding pocket. However, this is often detrimental in the long-run, as such a non-specific interaction will increase the chance of off-target binding or non-specific toxicity and this is reflected by a decrease in the LE or LLE [27].\n",
    "# Pareto Optimization\n",
    "# The concept known as Pareto optimality was proposed by an Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto in the early 20th Century [28]. He suggested that, when considering multiple parameters, there may not be a single best combination of parameters, but rather a family of solutions that each represents a different, optimal combination. More specifically, a solution to a multi-parameter optimization problem is considered to be a Pareto optimum if there is no other solution that is better in all of the parameters.\n",
    "# To illustrate this, consider the two-parameter example, illustrated in Figure 2(a), of a hypothetical drug discovery project which wishes to achieve an optimal balance of potency and metabolic stability to achieve good in vivo exposure and hence efficacy. Ideally, the project would like to identify a compound with high potency (pIC50) and good stability in human liver microsomes (% remaining after incubation for 40 minutes). This ideal goal is represented by the top right corner of the plots in Figure 2. However, as this ideal may be difficult or impossible to achieve, the project would like to find a good balance between potency and metabolic stability. The points shown as solid points in Figure 2 represent compounds with different, Pareto optimal combinations of these two parameters. For example, the point labeled A has no points that have both better potency and better metabolic stability, i.e. there are no points to the right and above; such a point is described as ‘non-dominated’. Contrast this with the point labeled B, which has a point, C, to the right and above representing a compound that is better in both parameters; B is ‘dominated’ by C. Note that the non- dominated points define a boundary, known as the ‘Pareto front’ and each represents a candidate for further investigation to identify the best balance of potency and metabolic stability to achieve in vivo efficacy.\n",
    "# The concept of Pareto optimality may be generalized to Pareto rank, whereby a point is ranked according to the number of points by which it is dominated, a rank-0 point is non-dominated, rank-1 is dominated by only a single point, etc. This allows compounds to be ranked according to how close they are to the optimum front.\"\"\"\n",

    "# <protocol> Lipophilicity is possibly the most important physicochemical parameter for any potential drug candidate. Lipophilicity measurements are valuable for understanding how drugs are dissolved in plasma and other aqueous biological fluids. Lipophilicity is typically accessed as the distribution of the tested compound between two solvents - typically non-aqueous organic (1-octanol) and aqueous (pH-buffered water), and then LogP is expressed as a Log of the concentration ratio between two phases. LogP is widely used in cheminformatics and is a component of Lipinski’s “rule of five”, which is a golden standard to evaluate a drug-likeness of a compound. According to this rule, the successful drug candidate should possess LogP value not greater than 5. \n",

    "\n",
    "Lipinski's Rule of Five (Ro5): This rule helps predict the oral bioavailability of a drug candidate. It states that a molecule is likely to have good oral absorption if it meets the following criteria:\n",
    "- Molecular weight ≤ 500 Da\n",
    "- Lipophilicity (logP) ≤ 5\n",
    "- Number of hydrogen bond acceptors ≤ 10\n",
    "- Number of hydrogen bond donors ≤ 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Pfizer Rule: This rule focuses on potential toxicity. It suggests that compounds with high lipophilicity (logP > 3) and low polar surface area (TPSA < 75) are more likely to be toxic.\n",
    "\n",
    "GSK Rule: This rule proposes that compounds with molecular weight ≤ 400 Da and logP ≤ 4 are more likely to have a favorable ADMET profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Golden Triangle Rule: This rule suggests that compounds with 200 Da ≤ molecular weight ≤ 350 Da and -2 ≤ logD ≤ 5 are more likely to have a favorable ADMET profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Veber's Rule: This rule expands on Lipinski's Ro5 by considering molecular flexibility. It suggests that good oral bioavailability is likely if:   \n",
    "- Number of rotatable bonds ≤ 10\n",
    "- Polar surface area ≤ 140 Å² or total number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors ≤ 12\n",
    "\n",
    "Rule of Three (Ro3): This rule is often applied in fragment-based drug discovery. It suggests that fragment hits should ideally have:   \n",
    "- Molecular weight ≤ 300 Da\n",
    "- cLogP ≤ 3\n",
    "- Number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors ≤ 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Other Considerations:\n",
    "- **Lead-likeness**: Similar to drug-likeness, but with more relaxed criteria, as lead compounds are often optimized further.\n",
    "- **Ligand Efficiency (LE)**: A measure of binding affinity relative to the size of the molecule. Higher LE is generally desirable.\n",
    "- **Lipophilic Efficiency (LiPE)**: A measure of potency relative to lipophilicity. Higher LiPE suggests a better balance between these properties.\n",
    "- **Synthetic Accessibility**: The ease with which a molecule can be synthesized. Easier synthesis is generally preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important Notes:\n",
    "- These rules are guidelines, not absolute requirements. There are exceptions to every rule, and the specific context of the drug discovery program should always be considered.\n",
    "- Experienced chemists often develop their own intuition and heuristics based on their experience and knowledge of specific drug targets and therapeutic areas.\n",
    "- Computational tools and predictive models are increasingly used to complement these manual rules and provide more quantitative predictions of ADMET properties.\n",

      "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the LogD, HLM, MLM, KSOL, and MDR1-MDCKII values for the given SMILES notation. Let's break it down step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand what each of these descriptors means. LogD is a measure of lipophilicity, which is how well a molecule interacts with organic lipids. High LogD values mean the molecule is more likely to be lipophilic. So, if I remember correctly, a LogD greater than 3 indicates high lipophilicity, which could be a problem for drug-like molecules because they might be metabolized more quickly, leading to toxicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "HLM stands for Human Liver Microsomal Stability. It measures how quickly a molecule is broken down by human liver microsomes. If HLM is high (T½ < 15 minutes), the molecule metabolizes rapidly, which could be concerning as it might be too unstable. If it's moderate (15 ≤ T½ < 30 minutes), the stability is acceptable, and if it's low (T½ ≥ 30 minutes), the molecule is slow to metabolize.\n",
      "\n",
      "MLM is Mouse Liver Microsomal Stability, similar to HLM but based on mouse microsomes. So, the same interpretation applies here.\n",
      "\n",
      "KSOL is about solubility, specifically how well the molecule dissolves in organic solvents. Low KSOL values indicate poor solubility, which can be a problem because solubility affects how the molecule behaves in biological systems, like how it might bind to cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "MDR1-MDCKII is about cell permeability, measuring how easily the molecule can pass through cell membranes. Low MDR1-MDCKII indicates poor permeability, which could be a security risk as the molecule might get into the bloodstream or other tissues where it's not desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, looking at the SMILES notation provided: CO[C@H]1C[C@H](N2N=CC3=C(C(=O)NC4=CC=C5CNCC5=C4)C=C(Cl)C=C32)C1. This looks like a complex molecule with a central ring structure, possibly a cyclic ether or similar. The presence of Cl and other substituents suggests that the molecule might be polar and have a good lipophilicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering LogD > 3, the molecule is likely to be lipophilic, which could be a concern if it's a drug candidate. However, the other descriptors (HLM, MLM, KSOL, MDR1-MDCKII) suggest moderate or fast metabolization and acceptable solubility and permeability. This combination might make it a candidate for further development or optimization.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, based on the analysis, the LogD is likely in the high range, indicating high lipophilicity. The other descriptors are moderate to acceptable, suggesting the molecule is stable and has good solubility and permeability, which are important for its potential use in drug delivery or cell signaling pathways.\n",

This feedback signal then goes back to our base model, helping it learn and adjust how it takes actions in the future to get even better Rewards.\n",

    "So that we have understand a basic RL flow now we need to learn what exact RL algorithm DeepSeek uses for R1-Zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many RL algos available, but traditional RL use something called a **“critic” **to help the main decision making part (“actor” i.e. DeepSeek-V3/Qwen2-0.5B). This critic is usually just as big and complex as the actor itself, which basically doubles the amount of computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "But DeepSeek uses GRPO for training their initial (R1 Zero), **GRPO** does things differently because it figures out a baseline, a kind of reference point for good actions directly from the results it gets from a **group** of actions. Because of this, GRPO doesn’t need a separate critic model at all. This saves a lot of computation and makes things more efficient.\n",
    "\n",

    "Let’s understand how DeepSeek GRPO implementation works with our base model (Qwen2–0.5B). \n",
    "\n",
    "First, the **Problem Input (A)** is given to the **Qwen Model (B)**, Qwen attempts to generate an answer through **Generate Completion (C)**. The final result, called the **Completion Output (D)**, includes reasoning steps in <think> tags and the final solution in <answer> tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the **Problem Input (A)** and the **Ground Truth Solution (E)** are fed into the **Reward Functions (F)**, acting as intelligent graders. These functions compare Qwen **Completion Output (D)** with the correct solution and evaluate different aspects such as:\n",

    " 4. **Cosine Scaling** (is the response concise?)\n",
    "\n",
    " 5. **Repetition Penalty** (is there unnecessary repetition?).\n",
    "\n",
    "These evaluations produce **Reward Scores (G)**, which are then passed to the **GRPO Trainer (H)**. The trainer uses gradients to adjust the **Qwen Model (B)**, fine-tuning how it generates answers. This process is called **Gradient Reward Policy Optimization** because it optimizes Qwen responses using **gradients**, **reward feedback**, and **policy adjustments** to maximize performance.\n",
    "\n",
