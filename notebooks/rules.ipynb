    "Assume you are a very experienced biologist/chemist. The following data includes molecules and their corresponding LogD value. Please infer step-by-step to come up with 3 rules that directly relate the properties/structures of a molecule (without access to 3D information). Context LogD Definition LogD (protocol): like solubility - but then in fatty tissue - LogD is a measure of a molecule's lipophilicity, or how well it dissolves in fat. LogD is calculated by comparing a molecule's solubility in octanol, a fat-like substance, to its solubility in water. Lipophilicity is possibly the most important physicochemical parameter for any potential drug candidate. Lipophilicity measurements are valuable for understanding how drugs are dissolved in plasma and other aqueous biological fluids. Lipophilicity is typically accessed as the distribution of the tested compound between two solvents - typically non-aqueous organic (1-octanol) and aqueous (pH-buffered water), and then LogP is expressed as a Log of the concentration ratio between two phases. LogP is widely used in cheminformatics and is a component of Lipinski’s “rule of five”, which is a golden standard to evaluate a drug-likeness of a compound. According to this rule, the successful drug candidate should possess LogP value not greater than 5. LogD is a distribution coefficient widely used to measure the lipophilicity of ionizable compounds, where the partition is a function of the pH. For nonionizable compounds LogP = LogD throughout pH range, whereas for ionizable compounds LogD takes into account the partition of both ionized and non-ionized forms. LogD is more convenient for practical measurements, as it takes into account solution pH, which is important for the analysis of the drug candidate properties in various biological media with different pH values. The shake flask method is considered the gold standard technique for determining log D. Protocol: Preparation of auxiliary solutions Preparation of auxiliary solutions 1d 1d 1 1 litre PBS: 0.01 M Phosphate buffer In a bottle for reagents with a cap of 1L capacity, place: contents of 1 L sachet with phosphate buffer, 1 L of water, mix thoroughly, and filter through a membrane filter with a pore diameter of 0.45 μm.

Below, fig. 1 shows the placement of microtubes on a plate to prepare 5 test and reference compounds. 8 The plate is installed in position \"G\" of the robotic station. Test and reference stock compounds should be placed in special holders, as shown in Fig. 2. 9 Plastic vials type \"Falcon 15 mL\" with PBS, 1-Octanol, and A40, and vials for a drain on the automatic station should be placed as shown in Fig. 3. 10 Place the box with tips 1000 µl and 200 µl in the indicated positions as shown in Fig. 4. 11 In the Lirix3 program Fig. 5, select the pre-created script for sample preparation.

After that liquid handler provides the next operations: 16.1 The first step is the dilution of 1-octanol in 100 times. In the microtubes \"…-о-100\" (see Fig. 5) plate position «D» add 990 µL А40 and 10 mL 1-octanol phase in the plate position «G», pipetting 5 times. 16.2 The second step is to remove the excess 1-octanol phase to expose the aqueous phase. 16.3 The next step is to transfer 300 µL PBS phase plate position «G» into microtubes \"…-p-1\" plate position «D» 16.4 The final, dilution PBS phase is 10 times. Into microtubes \"…-p-10\" plate position «D» add 225 µL A40 and 25 µL PBS phase in the microtubes \"…-p-1\" plate position «G», pipetting 5 times. 17 Analyse both the samples (both phases) using an HPLC system coupled with a tandem mass spectrometer. The Data: \n",
    " <data>\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "I. Fundamental Atomic/Group Contributions (Strongest Influences)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Carboxylic Acid Presence**: If the molecule contains a -COOH group (and is not zwitterionic), LogD is likely to be significantly reduced (often < 1). This is a dominant factor. RDKit: Can be detected by substructure matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Boronic Acid Presence**: Presence of -B(O)O, significantly decreases LogD, similar to carboxylic acids. RDKit: Substructure match.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiple Amide Groups**: Molecules with two or more amide groups (-C(=O)N-) generally have reduced LogD. RDKit: Count occurrences of the substructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Charged Nitrogen (Quaternary Amines)**: A positively charged nitrogen (e.g., in a quaternary ammonium salt) will strongly decrease LogD.  RDKit: Can detect this with careful substructure matching and checking formal charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sulfonic Acid**: -SO3H groups are very strong LogD decreasers. RDKit: Substructure match.\n",
    "\n",
    "II. Functional Group Effects (Moderate to Strong)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary/Secondary Amines**: Unsubstituted or alkyl-substituted amines (-NH2, -NHR) generally decrease LogD, although the effect is less dramatic than charged amines or amides. RDKit: Substructure matching and counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hydroxyl Groups**: Each -OH group tends to decrease LogD, with the effect accumulating with multiple hydroxyls.  RDKit: Count -OH groups (excluding those in carboxylic acids).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethers**: Ethers (-O-) have a mixed effect. A small number of ethers, especially in a larger molecule, might slightly increase LogD.  Many ethers, particularly in a small molecule, will tend to decrease LogD. RDKit: Count -O- (excluding those in esters, amides, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Halogens (F, Cl, Br)**: Halogens, especially fluorine and chlorine, tend to increase LogD. The effect is roughly additive.  RDKit: Count halogen atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trifluoromethyl Group**: The -CF3 group is a strong LogD increaser. RDKit: Substructure matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thioethers**: -S- connecting two carbons contributes to lipophilicity. RDKit: Substructure match.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sulfones/Sulfoxides**: S(=O)(=O) and S(=O) increase lipophilicity, although to a lesser extent than thioethers in similar contexts. RDKit: Substructure match.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ketones/Aldehydes**: Carbonyl groups (C=O) that are not part of amides or esters have a modest impact, often slightly lowering LogD. RDKit: Substructure matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Esters**: Esters (-C(=O)O-) have a mixed effect, often slightly lowering LogD, but less so than amides. RDKit: Substructure matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "III. Structural Features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aromatic Rings**: Each aromatic ring (benzene, etc.) generally increases LogD. RDKit: Use rdkit.Chem.Descriptors.NumAromaticRings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fused Aromatic Rings**: Fused aromatic systems (e.g., naphthalene, quinoline) have a stronger LogD-increasing effect than isolated rings. RDKit: Can be detected by analyzing ring systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aliphatic Rings**: Non-aromatic rings have a smaller effect than aromatic rings, but generally still increase LogD compared to open chains. RDKit: Use rdkit.Chem.Descriptors.NumAliphaticRings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chain Length**: Longer, uninterrupted alkyl chains (-CH2-CH2-CH2-...) increase LogD. RDKit: Can estimate by looking for longest chain without heteroatoms or branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Branching**: Branching in alkyl chains can have a complex effect.  Extensive branching can sometimes slightly reduce LogD compared to a straight chain of the same length, but this is a secondary effect. RDKit: More difficult to quantify precisely, requires graph analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heteroatoms in Rings**: The presence of N, O, or S within a ring generally decreases LogD relative to an all-carbon ring, especially if multiple heteroatoms exist. RDKit: Can be detected by analyzing ring systems and atom types within the rings.\n",
    "\n",
    "IV. Calculated Molecular Properties (RDKit Descriptors)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Molecular Weight (MW)**: Larger molecules tend to have higher LogD if the increase in size is due to non-polar groups.  But high MW due to polar groups can decrease LogD. RDKit: rdkit.Chem.Descriptors.MolWt.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Number of Rotatable Bonds**: Higher rotatable bond count can sometimes correlate with higher LogD, but this is a weak indicator on its own. More flexibility can allow a molecule to fit into a lipid environment. RDKit: rdkit.Chem.Descriptors.NumRotatableBonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total Polar Surface Area (TPSA)**: Higher TPSA strongly correlates with lower LogD. TPSA is a good measure of a molecule's polarity. RDKit: rdkit.Chem.rdMolDescriptors.CalcTPSA.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hydrogen Bond Donors**: More hydrogen bond donors (HBDs, usually NH and OH) decrease LogD. RDKit: rdkit.Chem.Descriptors.NumHDonors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hydrogen Bond Acceptors**: More hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs, usually N and O) tend to decrease LogD, but the effect is less strong than HBDs. RDKit: rdkit.Chem.Descriptors.NumHAcceptors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wildman-Crippen LogP (MolLogP)**: This calculated LogP value can be used as a baseline estimate. RDKit: rdkit.Chem.Crippen.MolLogP.\n",
    "\n",
    "V. Combinatorial and Contextual Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ratio of Polar to Non-polar Groups**: A high ratio of polar groups (amides, OH, etc.) to non-polar groups (alkyl chains, halogens) will generally lead to lower LogD.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Balance of Aromaticity and Polarity**: A molecule with many aromatic rings but also many polar groups can have a moderate LogD. The effects can partially offset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Lipophilic Efficiency\"**: A molecule with few polar groups, and many non-polar groups, will have high lipophilic efficiency, and thus, high LogD.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nitrogen Heteroatom Count in Rings**: Molecules with 2 or more nitrogen atoms inside a 5 or 6-membered ring generally exhibit decreased LogD, as they show higher polarity and water solubility.\n",
    "\n",
    "These 30 rules, combined with a good understanding of how they interact and sometimes oppose each other, provide a strong framework for predicting LogD from a SMILES string and RDKit-derivable properties. It's important to remember that these are guidelines, not absolute laws, and exceptions can occur. A machine learning model trained on a large dataset would be able to capture these nuances and interactions more effectively than a purely rule-based system."

    "\n",
    "1. If the SMILES contains “CC(C)(C)” (a tert‐butyl group) attached at a chiral center (e.g. “CC(C)(C)C@H”), then expect an increase in LogD by roughly 1–1.5 units compared to a similar scaffold lacking this group.\n",
    "2. If the molecule shows a fragment like “NC1=NC=NC2=C1C=C(C1=CN(…))N2” appended to a tert‐butyl bearing center, then LogD values typically fall in the ~3.1–3.2 range.\n",
    "3. If a structure features two or more fused aromatic rings (e.g. “C1=CC=C2…C2=C1”), then the overall lipophilicity is enhanced and LogD tends to be above 2.5.\n",
    "4. If an aromatic ring is directly substituted with halogens such as “Cl” or “F” (for instance, “C1=CC(Cl)=CC=C1”), then expect a boost in LogD by about 0.5 units relative to an unsubstituted ring.\n",
    "If multiple halogens are present on separate aromatic rings (e.g. both “Cl” and “F” on different rings), then the cumulative effect can raise LogD by around 1.0 unit or more.\n",
    "If the SMILES shows an “OCCOC” or “OCCOC2=” fragment (typical of ether linkers between aromatic rings), then these oxygenated linkers slightly reduce lipophilicity—often lowering LogD by 0.2–0.5 units compared to a direct aryl–aryl bond.\n",
    "If a sulfonyl fragment appears (i.e. “S(=O)(=O)”), especially appended to an aromatic or aliphatic segment, then LogD is reduced by roughly 0.5–1.0 units because of the high polarity of sulfonyl groups.\n",
    "If the structure contains an amide linkage (–C(=O)N–) not shielded by bulky groups, then expect a drop in LogD on the order of 0.3–0.7 units relative to analogous non‐amide linkers.\n",
    "If a free carboxylic acid group (“C(=O)O”) is present and not sterically hindered, then the compound tends to have a LogD that is 1–2 units lower than a similar ester or amide analogue.\n",
    "If a primary or secondary amine appears (e.g. “NC” or “N(C)C”) that is likely protonated at pH 7.4, then the molecule’s LogD will be lowered by approximately 1 unit relative to a neutral analogue.\n",
    "If a quaternary ammonium group (e.g. “N+(CH3)3”) is evident, then expect a dramatic drop in LogD – often resulting in near‐zero or negative values.\n",
    "If a heterocyclic aromatic ring contains a non‐protonated nitrogen (e.g. pyridine-like fragments such as “c1ccncc1”), then this feature tends to reduce LogD by 0.2–0.5 units relative to pure carbocyclic aromatics.\n",
    "If an extended conjugated system is present (for example, several aromatic rings linked by conjugated bonds), then the molecule often exhibits LogD values above 3 due to the cumulative hydrophobic surface.\n",
    "If polar groups (e.g. –OH, –NH2, –C(=O)O) are positioned so that intramolecular hydrogen bonding is likely, then their effective polarity is “masked” and LogD may be higher than predicted by counting polar groups alone.\n",
    "If a nitro group (–NO2) is present, then its strong electron‐withdrawing nature usually reduces LogD by about 1 unit or more.\n",
    "If an aromatic ether (Ar–O–Ar) is present rather than an aliphatic ether (R–O–R), then the effect on LogD is less pronounced—predict a LogD that is ~0.2–0.3 units higher than for an aliphatic ether analogue.\n",
    "If a carbonyl (C=O) is directly attached to an aromatic ring (as in an aromatic ketone), then expect a modest LogD reduction (around 0.3 units) versus a fully hydrocarbon substituted ring.\n",
    "If an alkyne is present in an aliphatic chain (e.g. “C#C” in “C#CCCC…”), then its low polarity means it contributes little to water solubility, keeping LogD relatively high.\n",
    "If the SMILES indicates a branched alkyl chain (such as an isopropyl group “CC(C)”) rather than a straight chain, then the branching typically increases LogD by enhancing hydrophobicity.\n",
    "If the structure contains multiple amide bonds in a row (e.g. a di- or tri-amide linker), then their combined polar effect can lower LogD by up to 1.5–2 units unless balanced by large lipophilic groups.\n",
    "If the molecule features a rigid bicyclic or polycyclic aromatic system (e.g. fused rings like “C1=CC2=CC=CC=C2C=C1”), then expect LogD values in the upper range (typically 2.5–4.0) because of the efficient stacking in lipophilic environments.\n",
    "If a spirocyclic motif is present, then the compact, three-dimensional arrangement often “hides” polar groups, leading to an increase in LogD by around 0.5 units relative to a more extended analogue.\n",
    "If the heterocycle is larger (e.g. a quinoline or isoquinoline instead of a pyridine), then the additional aromatic carbon atoms generally boost LogD by ~0.5–1.0 units.\n",
    "If bridging –CH2– groups are present between rings (e.g. “–CH2–” linking two aromatics), then these bridges increase hydrophobicity by reducing the effective polar surface area, raising LogD slightly.\n",
    "If the SMILES includes electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g. “CF3” or “Cl”) on an aromatic ring, then these groups reduce hydrogen-bonding capacity and typically increase LogD by about 0.3–0.7 units.\n",
    "If electron-donating groups (e.g. “OCH3”) are attached to an aromatic ring, then the increased polarity may lower LogD by ~0.2–0.5 units relative to a halogenated or unsubstituted ring.\n",
    "If a cyclic ether (e.g. a tetrahydrofuran ring represented as “C1CCOC1”) is incorporated, then its moderate polarity can reduce LogD by approximately 0.3–0.7 units compared to an all‐carbon ring of similar size.\n",
    "If the polar groups (such as amides or carboxyls) appear on the periphery of a large, lipophilic scaffold, then their impact on LogD is partially offset—resulting in LogD values that are about 0.5–1 unit higher than if the same polar groups were isolated.\n",
    "If steric hindrance is evident around a normally polar group (for example, an amide adjacent to a bulky tert‐butyl group), then the effective exposure of that polar functionality is reduced, leading to a higher LogD than predicted by polarity alone.\n",
    "If the overall structure can be roughly “fragmented” into lipophilic and hydrophilic pieces, then the net LogD is roughly additive. For example, two strongly lipophilic aromatic rings plus one polar amide might yield a predicted LogD in the range of 2.5–3.0, whereas replacing the amide with a carboxylic acid may drop the value by 1–1.5 units."
